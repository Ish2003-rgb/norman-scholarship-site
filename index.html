    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>The Norman Scholarship is dedicated to supporting students raised by single mothers—students who know struggle, perseverance, and the will to succeed. Named after my little sister, Normani, this scholarship honors the strength of my mother and the journey we’ve taken from Liberia to the U.S., from hardship to hope.</p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>I was raised by a single mom who had me at 17. She came to the U.S. and worked three jobs just to keep food on the table. I’ve seen her sacrifice everything—and I carry that with me every day. My little sister Normani is only four years old, but I know she’ll grow up in a world that may look down on her because she's Black and a woman. This scholarship is a promise that she—and others like her—won’t have to walk alone.</p>

    <h2>For Students</h2>
    <p>You weren’t given a head start—so we built one for you. If you were raised by a single mother, if you’ve had to grow up faster than most, if you’ve ever felt overlooked—this scholarship is for you. You deserve to dream big, and we’re here to help you do just that.</p>

    <h2>Message to My Family</h2>
    <p>To my mom—you are my hero. I watched you grind through sleepless nights, missed meals, and heartache just to give us a better shot at life. And to Normani—this world may try to break you. You’ll meet people who don’t see your worth, who doubt you before they know you. But you are powerful. You are brilliant. And you are never alone. This scholarship is your legacy. You will rise.</p>
